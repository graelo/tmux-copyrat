//! A tmux-plugin for copy-pasting spans of text from the [tmux] pane's history
//! into a clipboard.
//!
//! **Use case**: you're in tmux and your pane history has some dates you want to
//! copy. You press the key binding to highlight dates (see below for
//! configuration). `tmux-copyrat` kicks-in and highlights all spans of text which
//! correspond to a date. All spans are displayed with a one or two key _hint_,
//! which you can then press to copy-paste the span into the tmux clipboard or the
//! system clipboard. Check out the demo below.
//!
//! The name is a tribute to [tmux-copyrat], which I used for many years for that
//! same functionality. For this Rust implementation, I got inspired by
//! [tmux-thumbs], and I even borrowed some parts of his regex tests.
//!
//! Version requirement: _rustc 1.74+_
//!
//! ## Demo
//!
//! Pressing <kbd>prefix</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd> + <kbd>h</kbd> shows the following
//! hints on all hashes. Typing the hint letters will automatically copy the
//! hash in the tmux clipboard (or system clipboard if you prefer)
//!
//! ![[tmux-copyrat-hashes.png](images/tmux-copyrat-hashes.png)](images/tmux-copyrat-hashes.png)
//!
//! ## Usage
//!
//! First install and optionally customize the plugin (see both [INSTALLATION.md]
//! and [CONFIGURATION.md] pages) and restart tmux.
//!
//! Press one of the pre-defined tmux key-bindings (see table below) in order to
//! highlight spans of text matching a specific pattern. To yank some text span in
//! the tmux buffer, press the corresponding _hint_, or press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to
//! cancel and exit.
//!
//! If instead you want to yank the text span into the system clipboard, either
//! press the caps version of the key hint (for instance <kbd>E</kbd> instead of
//! <kbd>e</kbd>), or first toggle the destination buffer with the <kbd>space</kbd>
//! key and press the hint with no caps.
//!
//! You can also use the <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>N</kbd> (or <kbd>Up</kbd> and
//! <kbd>Down</kbd>) keys to move focus across the highlighted spans. Press
//! <kbd>y</kbd> to yank the focused span into the tmux buffer, or press
//! <kbd>Y</kbd> to yank it into the system clipboard.
//!
//! By default, span highlighting starts from the bottom of the terminal, but you
//! can reverse that behavior with the `--reverse` option. The
//! `--focus-wrap-around` option makes navigation go back to the first span. Many
//! more options are described in [CONFIGURATION.md].
//!
//! ### Matched patterns and default key-bindings
//!
//! tmux-copyrat can match one or more pre-defined (named) patterns, but you can
//! add your own too (see [CONFIGURATION.md]).
//!
//! The default configuration provided in the [`copyrat.tmux`](copyrat.tmux) plugin
//! file provides the following key-bindings. Because they all start with
//! <kbd>prefix</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd>, the table below only lists the keyboard key
//! that comes after. For instance, for URLs, the key is <kbd>u</kbd>, but you
//! should type <kbd>prefix</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd> + <kbd>u</kbd>.
//!
//! | key binding      | searches for                           | pattern name      |
//! | ---              | ---                                    | ---               |
//! | <kbd>c</kbd>     | Hex color codes                        | `hexcolor`        |
//! | <kbd>d</kbd>     | Dates or datetimes                     | `datetime`        |
//! | <kbd>D</kbd>     | Docker/Podman IDs                      | `docker`          |
//! | <kbd>e</kbd>     | Emails                                 | `email`           |
//! | <kbd>G</kbd>     | String of 4+ digits                    | `digits`          |
//! | <kbd>h</kbd>     | SHA-1/-2 short & long                  | `sha`             |
//! | <kbd>m</kbd>     | Markdown URLs `[..](matched-url)`      | `markdown-url`    |
//! | <kbd>p</kbd>     | Abs. and rel. filepaths                | `path`            |
//! | <kbd>P</kbd>     | Hex numbers and pointer addresses      | `pointer-address` |
//! |                  | strings inside single quotes           | `quoted-single`   |
//! |                  | strings inside double quotes           | `quoted-double`   |
//! |                  | strings inside backticks               | `quoted-backtick` |
//! | <kbd>q</kbd>     | strings inside single/double/backticks |                   |
//! | <kbd>u</kbd>     | URLs                                   | `url`             |
//! | <kbd>U</kbd>     | UUIDs                                  | `uuid`            |
//! | <kbd>v</kbd>     | version numbers                        | `version`         |
//! | <kbd>4</kbd>     | IPv4 addresses                         | `4`               |
//! | <kbd>6</kbd>     | IPv6 addresses                         | `6`               |
//! | <kbd>space</kbd> | All patterns                           |                   |
//!
//! ## Tmux compatibility
//!
//! `tmux-copyrat` is known to be compatible with tmux 3.0 onwards.
//!
//! Testing this kind of integration with tmux is time consuming, so I'll be
//! grateful if you report incompatibilities as you find them.
//!
//! ## The `copyrat` standalone executable
//!
//! Although the central binary of this crate is `tmux-copyrat`, the crate also
//! ships with the `copyrat` executable which provides the same functionality,
//! minus any tmux dependency or integration and instead reads from stdin.
//!
//! You can use `copyrat` to search a span of text that you provide to stdin, Ã  la
//! [FZF] but more focused and less interactive.
//!
//! For instance here is a bunch of text, with dates and git hashes which you can
//! search with copyrat.
//!
//! ```text
//! * e006b06 - (12 days ago = 2021-03-04T12:23:34) e006b06 e006b06 swapper: Make quotes
//! /usr/local/bin/git
//!
//! lorem
//! /usr/local/bin
//! lorem
//! The error was `Error no such file`
//! ```
//!
//! Let's imagine you want a quick way to always search for SHA-1/2, datetimes, strings within backticks, you would define once the following alias
//!
//! ```zsh
//! alias pick='copyrat -r --unique-hint -s bold -x sha -x datetime -x quoted-backtick | pbcopy'
//! ```
//!
//! and simply
//!
//! ```console
//! git log | pick
//! ```
//!
//! You will see the following in your terminal
//!
//! ![[copyrat-output.png](images/copyrat-output.png)](images/copyrat-output.png)
//!
//! You may have noticed that all identical spans share the same _hint_, this is
//! due to the `-unique-hint` option (`-u`). The hints are in bold text, due to the
//! `--hint-style bold` option (`-s`). Hints start from the bottom, due to the
//! `--reverse` option (`-r`). A custom pattern was provided for matching any
//! "loca", due to the `--custom-regex-pattern` option (`-X`). The sha, datetime
//! and content inside backticks were highlighted due to the `--named-pattern`
//! option (`-x`).
//!
//! ## Run code-coverage
//!
//! Install the llvm-tools-preview component and grcov
//!
//! ```sh
//! rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
//! cargo install grcov
//! ```
//!
//! Install nightly
//!
//! ```sh
//! rustup toolchain install nightly
//! ```
//!
//! The following make invocation will switch to nigthly run the tests using
//! Cargo, and output coverage HTML report in `./coverage/`
//!
//! ```sh
//! make coverage
//! ```
//!
//! The coverage report is located in `./coverage/index.html`
