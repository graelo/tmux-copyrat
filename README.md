A tmux-plugin for copy-pasting spans of text from the [tmux] pane's history
into a clipboard.

**Use case**: you're in tmux and press the key binding to highlight, say dates.
This makes `tmux-copyrat` search within tmux's current pane history and
highlight all spans of text which correspond to a date. All spans are displayed
with a one or two key _hint_, which you can then press to copy-paste the span
into the tmux clipboard or the system clipboard. Check out the demo below.

The name is a tribute to [tmux-copyrat], which I used for many years for that
same functionality. For this Rust implementation, I got inspired by
[tmux-thumbs], and I even borrowed some parts of his regex tests.


## Demo

[![demo](https://asciinema.org/a/232775.png?ts=1)](https://asciinema.org/a/232775?autoplay=1)


## Usage

First install and optionally customize the plugin (see both [INSTALLATION.md]
and [CONFIGURATION.md] pages) and restart tmux.

Press one of the pre-defined tmux key-bindings (see table below) in order to
highlight spans of text matching a specific pattern. To yank some text span in
the tmux buffer, press the corresponding _hint_, or press <kbd>Esc</kbd> to
cancel and exit.

If instead you want to yank the text span into the system clipboard, either
press the caps version of the key hint (for instance <kbd>E</kbd> instead of
<kbd>e</kbd>), or first toggle the destination buffer with the <kbd>space</kbd>
key and press the hint with no caps.

You can also use the <kbd>n</kbd> and <kbd>N</kbd> (or <kbd>Up</kbd> and
<kbd>Down</kbd>) keys to move focus across the highlighted spans. Press
<kbd>y</kbd> to yank the focused span into the tmux buffer, or press
<kbd>Y</kbd> to yank it into the system clipboard.

By default, span highlighting starts from the bottom of the terminal, but you
can reverse that behavior with the `--reverse` option. The
`--focus-wrap-around` option makes navigation go back to the first span. Many
more options are described in [CONFIGURATION.md].


### Matched patterns and default key-bindings

tmux-copyrat can match one or more pre-defined (named) patterns, but you can
add your own too (see [CONFIGURATION.md]).

The default configuration provided in the [`copyrat.tmux`](copyrat.tmux) plugin
file provides the following key-bindings. Because they all start with
<kbd>prefix</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd>, the table below only lists the keyboard key
that comes after. For instance, for URLs, the key is <kbd>u</kbd>, but you
should type <kbd>prefix</kbd> + <kbd>t</kbd> + <kbd>u</kbd>.

| key binding      | searches for                           | pattern name      |
| ---              | ---                                    | ---               |
| <kbd>c</kbd>     | Hex color codes                        | `hexcolor`        |
| <kbd>d</kbd>     | Dates or datetimes                     | `datetime`        |
| <kbd>D</kbd>     | Docker/Podman IDs                      | `docker`          |
| <kbd>e</kbd>     | Emails                                 | `email`           |
| <kbd>G</kbd>     | String of 4+ digits                    | `digits`          |
| <kbd>h</kbd>     | SHA-1/-2 short & long                  | `sha`             |
| <kbd>m</kbd>     | Markdown URLs `[..](matched-url)`      | `markdown-url`    |
| <kbd>p</kbd>     | Abs. and rel. filepaths                | `path`            |
| <kbd>P</kbd>     | Hex numbers and pointer addresses      | `pointer-address` |
|                  | strings inside single quotes           | `quoted-single`   |
|                  | strings inside double quotes           | `quoted-double`   |
|                  | strings inside backticks               | `quoted-backtick` |
| <kbd>q</kbd>     | strings inside single/double/backticks |                   |
| <kbd>u</kbd>     | URLs                                   | `url`             |
| <kbd>U</kbd>     | UUIDs                                  | `uuid`            |
| <kbd>v</kbd>     | version numbers                        | `version`         |
| <kbd>4</kbd>     | IPv4 addresses                         | `4`               |
| <kbd>6</kbd>     | IPv6 addresses                         | `6`               |
| <kbd>space</kbd> | All patterns                           |                   |


## Tmux compatibility

`tmux-copyrat` is known to be compatible with tmux 3.0 onwards.

Testing this kind of integration with tmux is time consuming, so I'll be
grateful if you report incompatibilities as you find them.


## The `copyrat` standalone executable

Although the central binary of this crate is `tmux-copyrat`, the crate also
ships with the `copyrat` executable which provides the same functionality,
minus any tmux dependency or integration and instead reads from stdin.

You can use `copyrat` to search a span of text that you provide to stdin, Ã  la
[FZF] but more focused and less interactive.

For instance here is a bunch of text, with dates and git hashes which you can
search with copyrat.

```text
* e006b06 - (12 days ago = 2021-03-04T12:23:34) e006b06 e006b06 swapper: Make quotes
/usr/local/bin/git

lorem
/usr/local/bin
lorem
The error was `Error no such file`
```

Let's imagine you want a quick way to always search for SHA-1/2, datetimes, strings within backticks, you would define once the following alias

```zsh
$ alias pick='copyrat -r --unique-hint -s bold -x sha -x datetime -x quoted-backtick | pbcopy'
```

and simply

```console
$ git log | pick
```

You will see the following in your terminal

![[copyrat-output.png](images/copyrat-output.png)](images/copyrat-output.png)

You may have noticed that all identical spans share the same _hint_, this is
due to the `-unique-hint` option (`-u`). The hints are in bold text, due to the
`--hint-style bold` option (`-s`). Hints start from the bottom, due to the
`--reverse` option (`-r`). A custom pattern was provided for matching any
"loca", due to the `--custom-regex-pattern` option (`-X`). The sha, datetime
and content inside backticks were highlighted due to the `--named-pattern`
option (`-x`).


## Standalone `thumbs`

This project started as a `tmux` plugin but after reviewing it with some
friends we decided to explore all the possibilities of decoupling thumbs from
`tmux`. You can install it with a simple command:

```
cargo install thumbs
```

And those are all available options:

```
thumbs 0.4.1
A lightning fast version copy/pasting like vimium/vimperator

USAGE:
    thumbs [FLAGS] [OPTIONS]

FLAGS:
    -c, --contrast    Put square brackets around hint for visibility
    -h, --help        Prints help information
    -m, --multi       Enable multi-selection
    -r, --reverse     Reverse the order for assigned hints
    -u, --unique      Don't show duplicated hints for the same span
    -V, --version     Prints version information

OPTIONS:
    -a, --alphabet <alphabet>                          Sets the alphabet [default: qwerty]
        --bg-color <background_color>                  Sets the background color for spans [default: black]
        --fg-color <foreground_color>                  Sets the foregroud color for spans [default: green]
    -f, --format <format>
            Specifies the out format for the picked hint. (%U: Upcase, %H: Hint) [default: %H]

        --hint-bg-color <hint_background_color>        Sets the background color for hints [default: black]
        --hint-fg-color <hint_foreground_color>        Sets the foregroud color for hints [default: yellow]
    -p, --position <position>                          Hint position [default: left]
    -x, --regexp <regexp>...                           Use this regexp as extra pattern to match
        --select-bg-color <select_background_color>    Sets the background color for selection [default: black]
        --select-fg-color <select_foreground_color>    Sets the foreground color for selection [default: blue]
    -t, --target <target>                              Stores the hint in the specified path
```


If you want to enjoy terminal hints, you can do things like this without `tmux`:

```
> alias pick='thumbs -u -r | xsel --clipboard -i'
> git log | pick
```


## Run code-coverage

Install the llvm-tools-preview component and grcov

```sh
rustup component add llvm-tools-preview
cargo install grcov
```

Install nightly

```sh
rustup toolchain install nightly
```

The following make invocation will switch to nigthly run the tests using
Cargo, and output coverage HTML report in `./coverage/`

```sh
make coverage
```

The coverage report is located in `./coverage/index.html`
